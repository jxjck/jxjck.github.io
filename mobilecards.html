                Anki is a software that uses a spaced-repetition algorithm to allow the user to efficiently retain large amounts of information. This card template is targeted at language learners who often use Anki on their mobile device as opposed to desktop. Is is a combination of HTML, CSS, and text-to-speech (TTS) to create vocabulary flashcards in the fastest way possible, while maintaining a high level of vocabulary retention. It places a focus on simplicity, while retaining enough information to be effective. Clicking the image below will redirect you to the git link. The text in the three files should be pasted into their respective fields in the Anki software.

                As of the writing of this article, current card formats often use example audio and screenshots in the card template, however, this is not optimal for mobile as audio recordings often take up too much storage space, and card information does not best utilise the screen real estate on mobile devices. This card template tackles these issues by utilising only four fields by default. These are: 言葉 (the word you want to remember), 読み方 (word reading), 意味 (meaning), and 文 (example sentence). 
                </p>

                It has been argued that an abundance of context is important for high retention of card information, however, spending time recording audio and creating other additional card elements often takes too much time and can be replaced by a TTS voice. In my experience, my retention of words did not drop when switching to this format, and using Anki became far more pleasureable as my daily usage time dropped significantly. Context is not entirely omitted by this template, as example sentences are encouraged to often contain nouns and specific terminology that allow you to easily remember where the sentence was pulled from, even without the original audio or a screenshot. The TTS tag on the card template works on all platforms by default, with the exception of Linux systems that require an additonal

                If you are creating Anki cards using the Yomitan browser extension, your fields should be occupied as such:

                <center><img src="images/yomitan.png" height="270" alt="yomitan settings page" title="Yomitan Settings"></center>
                
                <br>
                
                <h2><center>Card Usage</center></h2>   
                
                <p>
                When using the cards, I strongly recommend this approach:
                </p>
                
                <p>
                1) Grade yourself harshly on the reading of the word. This should be the main focus of your attention. If your mental voice says something different to the audio when flipping the card, fail it.
                </p>
                <p>
                2) A general understanding of the word's meaning is sufficient. Generally, understanding of words will come with more reading, listening and watching of content.
                </p>
                <p>
                3) Only use the pass and fail buttons when grading cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                4) Do not engage with the example sentence and audio if you are going to pass the card. This will speed up the review process significantly mitigating the reasons that new users of Anki often burn out.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                For card definitions, I recommend picking 1-2 English keywords for bilingual cards, and a short definition for monolingual cards. This is because shorter definitions are easier to check at a glance, as well as taking up minimal screen real estate on mobile devices. It may be tempting to add multiple definitions but in my opinion it is better to remember the one in the example sentence, and then acquire its other usages naturally through reading and listening.

                <p> 
                   If you wish to use the cards on both desktop and mobile, edit the numerical values in the .windows, .mac, or .linux wrappers in the CSS section of the card. They can be adjusted individually to suit your preferences for each platform. The back of the card template also includes the TTS tag for the sentence audio, but if you feel that this is not necessary it can be removed. To adjust the voice used during TTS, it is done within your device settings rather than within Anki.
                
                I've kept this article brief to keep the focus on the card template rather than other aspects of language learning. If you wish to learn more about that, I strongly recommend
