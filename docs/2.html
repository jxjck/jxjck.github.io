                Anki is a software that uses an algorithm to help users remember large amounts of information. This card template is for people that use it for language vocab on their phone. It's a combo of HTML, CSS, and text-to-speech (TTS).

                Current card formats usually use example audio and screenshots though this isn't optimal for mobile due to storage space and the amount of screen real estate. Without these elements word context isn't missing because example sentences will help you to remember where the word was pulled from. The TTS tag on the card template works on all platforms apart from Linux where you need an extra

                extension.
                </a>
                If you make cards using yomitan, make the fields look like this:
                </p>
                <center><img src="images/yomitan.png" height="270" alt="yomitan settings page" title="Yomitan Settings"></center>
                <br>
                <center><img src="images/ankicards.png" height="290" alt="anki card example" title="An example of a monolingual and bilingual card"></center>
                <br>
                <p> 
                  To use the cards on different platforms, edit the numbers in the .windows, .mac, or .linux CSS wrappers. The back of the card includes the TTS tag for the sentence audio but this line can be removed if you don't want it. To change the TTS voice change it in device settings rather than in Anki.
